 * \section connection_sec Connection Overview
 *
 * The pod communicates with Pi using Serial Cable. Hence, sensor reading data is
 * transferred through Serial. Every Sensor writes to Serial so that Pi can use that data.

 * This code base manage sthe code for all the sensors that are used on the pod.
 * Check the documentation of each class to get a better idea of what is happening.
