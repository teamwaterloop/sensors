The pod communicates with Pi using Serial Cable. Hence, sensor reading data is transferred through Serial. Every Sensor writes to Serial so that Pi can use that data.\hypertarget{index_project_sec}{}\section{Project Structure}\label{index_project_sec}
This code base manage sthe code for all the sensors that are used on the pod. Check the documentation of each class to get a better idea of what is happening.
