\subsection*{Workings of the Sensor}

This is for the control of the Balluff B\+FS 33\+M-\/\+G\+S\+S-\/\+F01-\/\+P\+U-\/02 Color Sensor, to be used to track the Pods movement. Check following links to learn more about this sensor\+:

\subsection*{Code Implementation}

The sensor has three output ports, Out 1 -\/ 3, which is used to describe the color said sensor detects. The values recorded for each Out range from 0 -\/ 1023 but the code implemented reduces the range to 0 \& 1 (for now).

The data sent to the dashboard is the color range value from 0 to 7.
