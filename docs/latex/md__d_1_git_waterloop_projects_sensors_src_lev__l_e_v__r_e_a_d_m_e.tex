This subsystem contains the D\+PR pressure sensor and the photoelectric distance sensor.

The \hyperlink{class_lev}{Lev} class must be instantiated with the pin numbers of the required analog pins.

Example data returned\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\{C++\}
// Min voltage
\{"time":0,"sensor":"distance","data":[0]\}

// Max voltage
\{"time":1,"sensor":"DPR","data":[1023]\}
\end{DoxyCode}


The {\ttfamily get\+\_\+distance()} and {\ttfamily get\+\_\+\+D\+P\+R()} functions return the 0-\/5V voltage scaled as an integer between 0 and 1023 inclusive.

The {\ttfamily print} functions print their respective values as J\+S\+ON to serial.
